  <h1>Walk Cambridge - Liability Disclaimer</h1>
  <p>Our walk leaders are unpaid volunteers who, as a condition of leading these walks, cannot accept the burden of
   any legal liability for your safety, nor liability for any losses that you may incur during the event, or during travel to or from
   it.&nbsp;  You therefore accept responsibility for your own safety, and attend entirely at your own risk.&nbsp;  Risks to yourself that
   you are responsible for include, but are not limited to:-
   <ul>
    <li>crossings of, or walks along the side of, roads with motor traffic;
    <li>uneven or slippy (e.g. icy) ground;
    <li>inclement weather;
    <li>dangerous animals (cattle, dogs, etc.);
    <li>any accidents or mishaps that you may suffer on your way to or from the event.
   </ul></p>
   <p>Your attendance indicates that you recognise and accept the above, and also recognise and accept that your walk leader:-
   <ul>
    <li>is not required to carry spare food, water, warm clothing, first-aid kit, torch, or any other equipment; and
    <li>may not have received any specialist training;
    <li>may not have reconnoitred ("recced") the route, and may therefore not be aware of every specific risk along the route.
   </ul></p>
  <p><strong>Note that all of the above is exactly the same as if you went walking with a group of friends.</strong></p>
